Adding a plant or equipment to a scape should automatically add a Tag / journal 
entry for long term trackability of tags. This will prevent looking up tank 
characteristics by tank description and remove the need to keep a list of item or
plants that are no longer with the tank's current setup.


Probably should create a business module that handles core fetching of model objects
